      <h3>Dahab</h3>
      <p>Dahab is one of the oldest and most famous dive areas in the Red Sea offering some of the most exciting and spectacular diving in Sinai. Dahab, which means ‘gold’ in Arabic, was named after its golden beaches, lying on the east coast of the Sinai Peninsula on the Gulf of Aqaba.
        The journey from the airport in the more touristy Sharm is an hour’s drive through the magnificent desert and mountains.</p>
